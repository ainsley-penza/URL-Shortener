#Dependencies:
Flask - Install by going to cmd and typing 'py -m pip install flask'
-- The other imports are pre-installed with Python (To install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/)

\\DO NOT change names of folders, because the system wouldn't work. Only change if you know how to arrange it.\\

This is hosted on your IP, and this is host that you would need to type in your browser. (192.168.0.105) <-- You can change this to your preferred host.
